Model Performance Summary
==========================

All models trained on Tripadvisor hotel reviews to predict sentiment: Negative, Neutral, Positive.

Two versions trained per model:
- Without class weights
- With class weights (to handle imbalance)

Best Model: CNN with class weights

Model Comparison (Validation F1-Score):

| Model               | F1 (No CW) | F1 (With CW) | Notes                     |
|---------------------|------------|--------------|---------------------------|
| Dense               | 0.78       | 0.79         | Improved with CW          |
| CNN                 | 0.82       | 0.83         | Best overall            |
| LSTM                | 0.80       | 0.81         | Slower, no big gain       |
| BiLSTM+Attention    | 0.80       | 0.82         | Complex, but not better   |

Key Metrics for Best Model (CNN + CW):
- Accuracy: 84.9%
- F1-Score (Weighted): 0.83
- Neutral Recall: 0.38
- Training Time: ~10 sec/epoch

Why CNN Won:
- Fast and accurate
- Handles mixed sentiment better after class weights
- Simpler than RNNs

Note:
- All models struggled with Neutral class (3-star, mixed sentiment)
- Class weights helped, but Neutral recall still low
- "But" and contrastive phrases are hard to classify
